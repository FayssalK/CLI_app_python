# CLI_app_python
This is an app that prompts LV1 CSRs while on a call

# Project Description

The task is to create an Command Line Interface (CLI) application that is aimed to help LV1 Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) save time and cost while entrering callers information and ease of escalation. The application will ensure that no steps are skipped. To make it possible, I used Python and VS Code to build the application.

# Technologies used in this project

- Python 3.x
  - File I/O
  - Collections
- Visual Studio Code
- MongoDB
- PyMongo
- git SCM (+ GitHub)

# Features

The app can create, read, update and delete data that is stored in a database.
It also reads JSON or CSV files, and stores the data contained within those files in a database.
IN addition, it has a CLI where users can interact with the application while it is running

# Usage

This project aims to bring in:
- shorter training time for new LV1 hires
- shorter average call time (the goal is to beat the 3 minutes Golden Rule of LV1 CS)
- No script to follow
- correct and efficient escalations
- higher volume of callls processed
- less need for new hires
